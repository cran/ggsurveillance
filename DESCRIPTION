Description: Create epicurves, epigantt charts, and diverging bar charts
    using 'ggplot2'. Prepare data for visualisation or other reporting for
    infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation (time
    series data).  Includes tidy functions to solve date based
    transformations for common reporting tasks, like (A) seasonal date
    alignment for respiratory disease surveillance, (B) date-based case
    binning based on specified time intervals like isoweek, epiweek, month
    and more, (C) automated detection and marking of the new year based on
    the date/datetime axis of the 'ggplot2', (D) labelling of the last
    value of a time-series.  An introduction on how to use epicurves can
    be found on the US CDC website (2012,
    <https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/epimode/index.html>).
