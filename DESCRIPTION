Description: Create epicurves or epigantt charts in 'ggplot2'. Prepare
    data for visualisation or other reporting for infectious disease
    surveillance and outbreak investigation. Includes tidy functions to solve
    date based transformations for common reporting tasks, like 
    (A) seasonal date alignment for respiratory disease surveillance, 
    (B) date-based case binning based on specified time intervals like
    isoweek, epiweek, month and more, (C) automated detection and marking
    of the new year based on the date/datetime axis of the 'ggplot2'. 
    An introduction on how to use epicurves can be found on the US CDC website 
    (2012, <https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/epimode/index.html>).
